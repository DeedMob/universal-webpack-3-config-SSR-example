# universal-webpack-3-config-SSR-example

An example config of using `universal-webpack` with react server rendering and webpack 3, for both dev and production builds.

Note this repo is for reference and will not run. I haven't added the dependencies either, but you can infer them from the files.

Run dev: `npm run dev`

Prod: `npm run build-prod-client` `npm run build prod-server` `npm run start`

Writing this config took me a long time, so I thought I'd share incase someone else had similar struggles
